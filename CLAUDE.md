# Project Configuration

## Quick Reference
- **Template Version**: 1.0.0
- **Bootstrap Status**: Check if `PRD.md` exists and `.claude/rules/` contains domain-specific rules
- **Codebase Map**: See `CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` — read before modifying any file, update after structural changes

## Core Principles

### File Ownership

Each type of content has exactly one owner. When information conflicts or you're unsure where something belongs, use this table:

| Content | Owned by | Read by |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Requirements (what to build) | `PRD.md` | agents, `/plan-feature` |
| Status, milestones, decisions, open questions | `ROADMAP.md` | agents, `/status`, `/plan-feature` |
| Behavioral constraints (what NOT to do) | `.claude/rules/` | agents during implementation |
| Cross-session learnings | `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` | agents (auto-loaded first 200 lines) |
| File structure & purposes | `CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` | agents before any file modification |
| SDK/framework API reference | `*-truth.md` | agents, post-edit hooks |

### Three-Layer Enforcement Model
1. **Memory** (`MEMORY.md`) — Cross-session learnings. First 200 lines auto-loaded. Learning layer.
2. **Rules** (`.claude/rules/`) — Active instructions. Always-on globals + path-matched domain rules. Instruction layer.
3. **Hooks** (`.claude/scripts/`) — Shell scripts on lifecycle events. Cannot be skipped. Guarantee layer.

### Escalation Path — Rules Are Earned, Not Pre-Generated

```
AI mistake happens once       → add to MEMORY.md
Same mistake recurs           → promote to a rule in .claude/rules/
Mistake is dangerous/critical → enforce with a hook in .claude/scripts/
```

Domain-specific rules should emerge organically through this path. The bootstrap only generates universal rules + one SDK rule. All other rules are created when patterns prove they need enforcement.

**The Rule Litmus Test:** Rule files must contain ONLY behavioral constraints — never requirements, implementation plans, or open questions. If deleting a rule wouldn't make the agent produce worse code, it doesn't belong.

### Source-of-Truth Hierarchy
When information conflicts, resolve using this priority order:
1. **Compiler/type-checker output** — highest authority (deterministic)
2. **Truth file** (`*-truth.md`) — auto-generated from type definitions
3. **Official documentation** (via MCP or web)
4. **Rules** (`.claude/rules/`)
5. **Memory** (`.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`)
6. **AI training knowledge** — lowest authority (may hallucinate)

### Scope Discipline
- **Only modify files explicitly relevant to the current task**
- **Never add features that weren't requested**
- **If a change requires modifying more than 3 files, pause and confirm the plan with the user**
- **Read CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md before touching any file** to understand dependencies

### Verification Protocol
Before using any SDK/framework API:
1. Check the truth file for existence (cite file + line number)
2. If not in truth file, check official docs via MCP or web
3. If still uncertain, ask the user — never guess
4. After implementation, the post-edit hook will verify imports automatically

## Available Skills
- `/bootstrap` — Analyze a PRD and generate domain-specific .claude configuration
- `/commit` — Stage, validate, and commit with conventional commit format
- `/validate` — Run the full validation pipeline (type-check + truth-file cross-reference)
- `/plan-feature` — Decompose a complex feature into sequenced implementation steps
- `/review` — Trigger the code-reviewer agent on recent changes
- `/status` — Show current milestone, recent activity, open questions from ROADMAP.md

## Available Agents
- `bootstrap-orchestrator` — Reads PRD, generates domain-specific agents/rules/hooks/skills
- `code-reviewer` — Reviews code for correctness, type safety, scope. Reports only, does NOT fix.
- `implementer` — Implements features. The main workhorse. Reads truth file first.
- `devops` — Git operations, commits, CI/CD. Lightweight procedural tasks.

## Project-Specific Configuration
> After running `/bootstrap`, this section will be populated with domain-specific details.
