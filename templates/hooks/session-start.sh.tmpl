## Session Start — Critical Facts

### Infrastructure Reminders
- Read CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md before modifying files
- Read the truth file before using any SDK/framework API
- Check .claude/rules/ for domain-specific rules when working on relevant files
- Scope discipline: only modify files relevant to the current task

### Verification Protocol
1. Truth file → 2. Official docs → 3. Ask user. Never guess.

### Common AI Failure Modes to Avoid
- Do NOT fabricate APIs — if you can't verify it exists, ask
- Do NOT modify unrelated files — stay in scope
- Do NOT self-verify — let hooks and the reviewer agent validate your work
- Do NOT leave wrong code with warning comments — delete fabricated code entirely
