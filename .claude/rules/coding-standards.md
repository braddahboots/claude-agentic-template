# Coding Standards

> **Note:** This file should be customized by the `/bootstrap` skill based on your project's tech stack. The defaults below are universal principles.

## Universal Principles

1. **Type safety first** — Use the language's type system fully. Avoid escape hatches (`any` in TS, `Any` in Python, `interface{}` in Go).
2. **Explicit over implicit** — Prefer named parameters, explicit return types, and clear variable names.
3. **Error handling** — Every external call (API, DB, file I/O) must have error handling. Never silently swallow errors.
4. **No magic numbers** — Extract constants with descriptive names.
5. **Single responsibility** — Each function does one thing. Each file has one clear purpose.
6. **Prefer composition over inheritance** — Unless the SDK/framework mandates inheritance.
