# Commit Workflow

## Steps

1. **Check status**: Run `git status` to see what's changed
2. **Run validation**: Execute the project's validation command (check CLAUDE.md for the specific command)
   - If validation fails, report errors and stop — do not commit broken code
3. **Stage changes**: Run `git add` for the relevant files
   - Only stage files related to the current task
   - If unrelated changes exist, warn the user
4. **Generate commit message**: Use conventional commit format:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <short description>

   <optional body>
   ```
5. **Commit**: Run `git commit` with the generated message
6. **Confirm**: Print the commit hash and summary
